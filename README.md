# Ensemble Learning

The project was inspired by the [WINGBEATS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/potamitis/wingbeats) and [ABUZZ](http://web.stanford.edu/group/prakash-lab/cgi-bin/mosquitofreq/the-science/figures-2/) datasets that collect sound recording of mosquitoes with the aim of improving the models that identify and classify mosquito species. This task is essential for the purposes of disease surveillance and vector control, since mosquito-borne diseases, such as Dengue fever, Zika, Malaria and others,  are extremely widespread globally and they pose a grave risk for humans. 

The analysis includes a complete pipeline from raw .wav sound data transformation to final classsification results. Class imbalance is addressed using two distinct approaches for data augmentation, and the classification task is approached by using two methodologies. Random forests are implemented, with the parameters of the model fine-tuned on four distrinct classification result metrics. Additionally, ensemble learning is implemented by using the XGBoost algorithm, which provided the best performance on the analysed dataset.

# Named Entity Recognition

"the Georgetown University Multilayer (GUM) corpus is a collection of texts gathered and refined through classroom annotation using collaborative software. Collected as an integral component of the linguistics curriculum at Georgetown University, the GUM corpus is specifically oriented toward contemporary English data, it is then tailored to meet the requirements of the corpus and computational linguistics research (Zeldes, 2017)."
